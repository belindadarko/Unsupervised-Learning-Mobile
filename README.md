# Unsupervised Learning Mobile App Behavior

This is an analysis and interpretation of an unsupervised learning problem based on survey data about mobile app behavior done by my team members Alliyah Thompson, Jian Li, Khoa Le and myself Belinda Darko. 

Various unsupervised machine learning algorithms were used such as PCA, Scree plots, Clustering, Dendrogram, and Boxplots to create clusters based on Survey Data, to be able to determine solid recommendations to the marketing departments in the industry relating to mobile app.

See survey questions and Python file for an in-depth executive summary and insights derived from the analysis.
